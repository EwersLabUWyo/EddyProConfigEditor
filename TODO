* follow gerardo's directions: each processing.eddypro file needs its own environment. This means that you need the following:
    * processing.eddypro
    * eddypro_fcc
    * eddypro_rp
    * static.metadata
    * dynamic.metadata
    * planar fit file
    * spectral assessment
    * binned cospectra! I think
    * This is probably best done by asking for a template directory that contains all of this stuff, that can be simply copied.
* improve documentation
* include a test dataset with a walkthrough on how to run it.
